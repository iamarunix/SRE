  SLO service level objective 

SRE:
  share ownership
  SLO
  Blameless postmortem's
  reduce cost of failure 
  Implement Automation -Reduce Toil 
  operation as software problem 

SRE principles
  - Reduce org silos 
  - accept failure as normal 
  - implement gradual change
  - leverage tooling n automation 
  - measure everything 


  - Embrace risk 
  - Eliminating Toil
  - Monitoring distributed systems
  - Automation
  - Release engineering (both application and infra deployments shd be in code level) 
  - Simplicity 


Availabilty
  (no of minutes system is working well/total min  ) *100 
  It means the system is operatable at a given time
  RTO (recovery time objective)is the targeted duration of time that a service must be restored after a failore 
  MTTR is also the same
 
# SLI Service Level Indicator - meaningful measurement of service - it's a measurement for SLO  
  - Latency  
   - availability 
   - error rate 
   - throughput 
   - response time 
# SLO Service Level Objective
 - collection of SLO 
# SLA Service Level Agreement
